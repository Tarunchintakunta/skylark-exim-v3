# HIGGSFIELD_LOG

Media pass per docs/HIGGSFIELD.md + docs/HIGGSFIELD_STORYBOARD.md (issue #175). Masters in `masters/<shot>/` (gitignored, never committed).
Start balance 1910.75 credits (max plan). Credit guard: stop all generation at 1624 credits spent (balance <= 286). Spend is tracked from `balance` calls only.

## 2026-10-10: paused before the first generation
The lead halted the pass on Tarun's order: Higgsfield is paused until the Blender finals are done. No job was submitted. Credits spent: 0. Balance still 1910.75 (max plan). Resume at A2 catch.

## 2026-10-11: resumed (Higgsfield producer)

### Decisions
- **Video model: `minimax_h3` 2K** (10 credits / 5 s). Comparison on HS03 (same start frame, same prompt): minimax_h3 returned 2560x1440 H.264 24 fps, 124 frames, people and rope detail sharp in every sampled frame; `seedance_2_5` 1080p `bitrate_mode: high` (60 credits) returned 1920x1080 HEVC 10-bit 24 fps, 121 frames, but drifted into heavy defocus by 50-100 % and lost face/hand detail. Picked minimax_h3 by contact sheet. Both outputs are 24 fps (no resample needed). minimax output carries an AAC track; it is dropped at encode (`-an`).
- **People start frames: `gpt_image_2_5` quality max, 4k** (15 credits). Comparison on HS03 vs `nano_banana_pro` 4k (4 credits; the job reported model `nano_banana_2`): nano copied the CG poses (lunging figures, hands not on the rope); gpt_image_2_5 gave natural hauling poses with gloved hands on the rope and real faces. Output 3840x2160.
- **Shots without people:** take 1 animated straight from the Blender still (HS01, HS06, HS19, HS20) all read as CG (flat block buildings, toy water/ponds, plastic crane paint). Take 2 for those uses a gpt_image_2_5 realism pass that keeps the Blender composition (the "change the start still" step of HIGGSFIELD.md §3.4).
- **Content rule (coordinator, 2026-10-11):** a closed ring of floats on the sea implies a gear on the never-write list. Sea shots must show the net hauled over the side, a straight float line from the hull or a heaped net; every sea prompt carries "no circular float ring, no encircling net"; no gear is named in prompts. HS03 take 1 PASS revoked for this.
- Reference grading: real photos are viewed in the browser only (nothing downloaded, uploaded or committed). Bing image results for Visakhapatnam crews hauling nets: crews mostly in T-shirts, lungis or shorts, often barefoot, many hands on deck; PVC oilskins mostly appear in non-Indian trawler photos. Our catch frames keep the oilskins from the scene reference; harbour/pond frames use lungis, vests, saris, sandals, which matches the real photos.

- **Seams (coordinator):** neighbouring shots at the same location were regenerated with `end_image` = the next shot's start frame (10 takes, 100 credits). Only HS13 → HS15 passed (the camera glides from the peeling table through the glass door into the lab). The other nine morphed, dissolved, cut mid-clip or never reached the end frame, so those joins keep the 3 % poster cross-fade.
- **Retakes requested by Tarun (2026-10-11):** HS20 (the ship must visibly leave; crane cables must not cross the boom), HS08 (no cropped head on the bottom edge), HS10 (the truck must reverse to the dock). The start frames were fixed first with a gpt_image_2_5 edit pass, then animated.
- **Upscaling not used:** the masters are 2560x1440 and the largest tier is 1920, so `upscale_video` would add nothing.
- **Weight budget held (Tarun):** every clip is trimmed to the 72 frames (3.0 s) its scroll segment needs, at the same bitrate as the full clip, so per-clip quality is unchanged and the files are about 42 % smaller. The window keeps the most motion; seam frames are kept (HS13 ends on HS15's start, so HS13 keeps its tail and HS15 its head). Desktop takes the 1920 tier only above 1600 device px; phones scrub the 720 tier and prefetch only the next clip.

### Final clips (trimmed to 72 frames, 3.0 s at 24 fps; before: 124 frames, 5.17 s)
SSIM = 1920 tier vs the trimmed master. Sizes in KB, tiers 1920/1280/960/720 (caps 2,250/2,300/1,400/1,230 in tests/weight.spec.ts). H.264 High, two-pass, GOP 6, no B-frames, faststart, no audio.

### Seams (boundary SSIM between neighbouring clips, 1920 tier, measured before trimming; trimmed heads and tails change the cross-fade values, not the shared frame)
Cross-fade joins (separate shots): 01>02 0.42, 02>03 0.22, 03>04 0.16, 04>05 0.19, 05>10 0.32, 06>09 0.25, 09>07 0.23, 07>08 0.18, 08>10 0.22, 10>11 0.38, 11>12 0.29, 12>13 0.34, 15>14 0.35, 14>16 0.39, 16>17 0.53, 18>19 0.28, 19>20 0.18. Shared frame: 13>15 0.96.

### Balance (from `balance` calls only)
| When | Balance | Spent |
|---|---|---|
| start | 1910.75 | 0 |
| after HS03 images | 1891.75 | 19 |
| after first 3 batches | 1656.75 | 254 |

| after plant and remaining shots | 1251.75 | 659 |
| after seam takes | 1151.75 | 759 |
| after Tarun's retakes (3 images, 4 videos) | 1066.75 | 844 |

Credit guard (1,624) not reached: 844 spent, 44 % of the start balance.

## 2026-10-11 (evening): docs chapter, chapter audit, hero loop (#196, #197)

| Shot | Kind | Job | Credits | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HERO | video, minimax_h3 6 s, start = end = HS01 frame | c54da13b | 12 | PASS (with cross-dissolve) | last vs first frame SSIM 0.936 is a visible step; the last 0.5 s is cross-dissolved into the start, so the seam is 0.964, inside the clip's own frame-to-frame range (0.959-0.998). Gulls stay put across the seam. A faint wing double-exposure shows for about 0.2 s. PR #205 |
| DOCS | image, gpt_image_2_5 max 4k | 7dcd96d3 | 15 | PASS | export-office desk; depth of field makes every page and screen unreadable (zoom-checked); left third dark for the copy |
| HS21 | video, minimax_h3 5 s, start = HS20 frame 71 | 03c256e6 | 10 | PASS (trimmed 44-123) | the camera rises over the ship as it sails into deep blue water; the crane boom bends as it leaves the frame before frame 44, so those frames are cut. Replaces the Blender x-ship clip |

Audit (1440 and 390 px, both paths, every chapter at 30 % and 75 % of its scroll): two leftovers found. The docs chapter was a blurred, darkened smudge, and the second half of the sea chapter was the Blender x-ship clip (CG crane, toy ship). Both are fixed in #196. Every other chapter is Higgsfield footage.

Balance (from `balance` calls): 1066.75 before. Then 804.75 after these three jobs, a drop of 262, of which 37 is mine. The other 225 is 15 GPT Image 2.5 generations at 15:24 and 15:44 UTC by a parallel website session on the same account, per the transactions API and the coordinator. Spend since the 1910.75 start: 1106 (all sessions). Credit guard (1,624) not reached.

## 2026-10-12: pond retakes (#224)

Start frames: gpt_image_2_5, quality max 4k, three candidates per shot (contact sheets in docs/review/retakes). The pick is uploaded as a 2560 px JPEG and used as the minimax_h3 2K start image. minimax_h3 at 4 s failed twice (refunded); at 5 s it renders, so every clip is 5 s and trimmed to 72 frames.

| Shot | Kind | Job | Credits | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| p2 sample, frames a/b/c | image, gpt_image_2_5 max 4k | 4d2b3e3e / 22c35303 / f7a1fa22 | 45 | b picked | all three pass the brief (meter on a cable, probe in the water, no poles). a: the aerator is small and far off. c: tighter framing, with the meter raised close to his face. b: he looks down at the meter, and the aerator splash fills the middle of the frame |
| p2 sample | video, minimax_h3 2K 5 s, start = b | e282315f | 10 | PASS (trimmed 0-71) | he taps the meter and reads it; the cable hangs naturally; nothing is lifted toward camera; no poles |
| p3 harvest, frames a/b/c | image, gpt_image_2_5 max 4k | 580f99ce / 75985b3e / 4ca3020d | 45 | b picked | a: the float line runs out of the frame at both bottom corners, so the arc does not read. c is also clean. b: the whole float arc sits in front of the four workers, with blue crates, white ice boxes and a plain white truck on the bank |
| p3 harvest | video, minimax_h3 2K 5 s, start = b | 1d6c2362 | 10 | PASS (trimmed 0-71) | the crew pulls the head rope; the float arc tightens in front of them and stays one line; the bank crew lifts blue crates |

The 1920 poster of hf-harvest missed the 120 KB cap even at q 12 (sunlit water), so encode-hf.sh now falls back to a cwebp size search.
