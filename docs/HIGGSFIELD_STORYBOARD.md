# HIGGSFIELD_STORYBOARD.md: the story, shot by shot

Extends `docs/HIGGSFIELD.md` (global rules, review gate, log format). Issue #175. Every shot is **image-to-video**: a fresh Blender still of the matching scene is the start frame, so composition, set and vehicles stay Blender's; Higgsfield adds real people, skin, fabric, water, ice and motion. Port, cranes, ship and globe stay Blender-led.

## Corrections to HIGGSFIELD.md (facts rules win)
- Shot C5 said "blast freezer". "blast freezing" is on the `docs/CONTENT.md` "Never write" list: prompts say **plate freezer / freezer room / IQF tunnel** only.
- `BANNED_CLAIMS.md` does not exist. The banned list is the `docs/CONTENT.md` "Never write" section plus "Bay of Bengal" and "purse seine". None of those words go into a prompt.
- The global block's "subtle handheld" is dropped: clips are scrubbed by scroll, so the camera must be locked to one slow, eased move (handheld shake reads as jitter when scrubbed).
- No celebrities, no identifiable real people, no real brand logos, no readable names, numbers or signs (the p-sample meter shows "7.8": that frame is not used).

## Common settings
- Model: `minimax_h3` 2K (default) vs `seedance_2_5` 1080p `bitrate_mode: high`: one comparison take on the first A shot, decision by contact sheet, logged.
- 16:9, 5 s default (8 s max), no audio, one continuous slow move in the scroll direction, no cuts, no morphing. Output resampled to 24 fps in the encode if the model returns another rate (logged).
- Start still: `hf-stills/<shot>.png`, rendered fresh at 1920×1080 from the named .blend/frame (EEVEE, saved scene settings). End still only where two Higgsfield shots chain inside one chapter.
- Prompt = subject + action + environment + light + camera move + lens + "photorealistic documentary, natural skin texture, real fabric, wet surfaces, shallow depth of field" + the global block (with the corrections above).
- People, everywhere: South Indian, mixed ages (20s to 50s), mixed builds, natural dark-brown skin with real pores and sweat sheen, natural relaxed postures, eyes on the task, nobody looks into the lens, no posing. Faces stay mid-distance or turned; hands are the close-up subject.
- Plant PPE (every plant shot): light coloured coveralls or white coats, hairnet under a cap, surgical face mask, waterproof apron, nitrile gloves, white wellington boots. Fishers and pond farmers: no PPE beyond rubber gloves and boots.

## Priorities
HIGGSFIELD.md marks A = must, B = nice but labels shots A/B/C/D. Applied here: the human-heavy shots (A1–A4, C1–C6) are **A**; pond, cold store, stuffing and the Blender-led port/ship are **B**.

Site order differs from the beat numbers in two places and the wiring follows the site: `p2` (sampling) plays before `p3` (harvest), and the `coldchain` captions run lab → freezing → packing → cold storage. Joins between Higgsfield shots and remaining Blender/old clips are cross-fades unless `boundary-check.sh` passes.
